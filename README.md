# ros_imu_covariance_calculator
ROS Package to estimate the variance of the inertial data from an IMU  to be used to populate the error covariance matrix

## Usage:
* put the IMU in a stable position and start the relative ROS node
* launch the covariance calculator ```$ roslaunch ros_imu_covariance_calculator imu_cov_calc.launch```
* wait for the results
